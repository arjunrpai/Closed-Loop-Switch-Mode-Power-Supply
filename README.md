# Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS) – Closed Loop Control

## 📌 Overview
This project presents a **MATLAB/Simulink simulation of a closed-loop Switch Mode Power Supply (SMPS)**. The system uses **PWM-based switching** and a **PID controller** to regulate the output voltage under varying load conditions.

## ⚙️ System Description
The SMPS model consists of a **DC–DC converter** controlled by a PWM generator. The output voltage is sensed and fed back to a PID controller, which dynamically adjusts the duty cycle to maintain the desired reference voltage.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- MATLAB  
- Simulink  
- Simscape Electrical  

## 📊 Results
- Stable output voltage regulation  
- Reduced ripple voltage  
- Improved transient response using PID control
